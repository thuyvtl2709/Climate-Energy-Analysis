# Our Contribution

Our project is dedicated to analyzing the influential factors encompassing energy consumption, population dynamics, climate patterns, and natural disasters on an annual basis. Subsequently, we devise strategic initiatives aimed at environmental preservation and sustainability. 

In my role, I specifically concentrate on the demographic aspects of this analysis.

I utilize Python to assess the CO2 emissions levels from the year 1985 to 2022 across continents. Subsequently, I investigate the impact of population dynamics on CO2 emissions for each continent in 2022. Additionally, I identify the top 10 countries with the highest and lowest CO2 emissions in 2022. This comprehensive analysis enhances the project's completeness and provides a broader understanding of the factors influencing climate, thereby facilitating the formulation of more tailored population policies for the future.
